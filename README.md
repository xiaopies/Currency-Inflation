##WHAT IS IT?

This model simulates a world of 200 identical countries, each with its own currency. All countries start with the same economic fundamentals and experience identical, rapid inflation. The model explores whether currencies can still diverge in strength over time due purely to small, random fluctuations — a visual demonstration of symmetry breaking, path dependence, and emergent inequality in global currency systems.

##HOW IT WORKS

Each country inflates its currency identically but receives a small random shock each tick; these compound, creating divergence in currency strength.

##HOW TO USE IT

Set a noise-level, click setup, then click go. The plot shows how much currencies diverge over time.

##THINGS TO NOTICE

Without noise, currencies remain identical. With noise, small differences gradually lead to dominance and inequality.

##THINGS TO TRY

Increase or decrease noise-level to observe how quickly divergence accelerates. Try setting it to 0 and confirm no movement occurs.

##EXTENDING THE MODEL

Add peg behavior, slight inflation differences, or currency-switching to simulate real-world effects like reserve currency dominance.
